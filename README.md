Bookmark Landing Page
The objective of this project was to build a fully responsive and functional landing page using Bootstrap.

Technologies
HTML5: Semantic structure of the content.

Sass (SCSS): Used for style nesting and the definition of design variables.

Bootstrap 5: Primary CSS framework used for layout and components.

JavaScript (Bootstrap JS): Required for the functionality of the collapsible navbar and the tabs.

Features
Fully Responsive Design: Adapts correctly to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

Responsive Tabs System: Advanced use of Bootstrap's tab navigation, which adapts to stack vertically on mobile and display horizontally on desktop.

Grid Layout with Flexbox: Intensive use of Bootstrap's Flexbox utilities (such as d-flex, justify-content-between, align-items-center) and the Grid system to construct the section layouts.

Minimal SCSS: Priority was given to using Bootstrap utility classes, reserving SCSS only for essential visual styles (colors, fonts, shadows, and the complex layout logic for the overlay).

Accessibility (ARIA): ARIA attributes have been included to enhance the experience for users with screen readers.

Usage and Viewing
To view and test the project:

Clone the repository onto your machine.

Install dependencies (if you are using an SCSS/NPM development environment).

Open in the browser: Simply double-click the index.html file to open the page.
